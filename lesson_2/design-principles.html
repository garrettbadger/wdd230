                    The mobile site for Hoonigan was a great representation of <b>Fitt's law</b>. This the design principle that the smaller the target to either click or touch, the longer
                    it will take for the user to make a decision. Hoonigan has a very large picture right on the front of their mobile page that cycles through their different
                    products. This makes it quite easy to select what you want in a way that is convenient especially on a mobile touch screen.

                    Lamborghini's website was not cluttered at all and has a very <b>clean design</b>. It was easy to see that they let their products do most of the talking and didn't bother adding too much
                    design that could distract the user. They utilize their <b>whitespace</b> very well. On the mobile version you can pretty much only see their use of micro whitespace just because
                    it is a smaller screen size. Overall this site works very well on mobile and it not too claustrophobic.

                    The Church's website was a great example of one of the big four principles of design, <b>repetition</b>. They have multiple block elements that all follow a 
                    similar pattern. They have a picture as the background and toward the bottom is the title of what that element is about. Each element is separated by the same
                    amount of white space and each element is the same size. It shows a uniformity that is pleasing to the user.
