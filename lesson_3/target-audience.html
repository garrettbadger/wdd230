            <p>Target Audience: My target audience for this website is mainly for adults who live in the South East part of Idaho. Especially for younger adults who are looking to meet people or take their kids to fun events.</p> <br>
            <p>Persona: Jake is a 26 year-old newly wed with a 2-year old daughter named Ashley. Him and his wife love to be involved in the community and know whats going on around them. They also like to be prepared and always make sure they check
                the forecast. What Jake and his wife need is a website that has it all, community, events, and weather. 
            </p>
            <p>Scenario: Jake just found a sitter for his daugher Ashley and is looking for something fun to do on the weekend with his wife. 
                He decides to check out seidahocommunity.com for any potential events that are happening this weekened. He sees that there is a country concert happening in a park only 5 minutes away from his house. Him and his wife have 
            a great evening at a local concert with people from their community because of this website.</p>
